# When your subscription renews

Your subscription renews automatically at the end of each billing cycle (monthly or yearly, depending on your plan).

* After each successful payment, you will receive an email confirmation. That email includes your new subscription end date.
* If a payment fails, your subscription will be cancelled immediately. You will also get an email notification about the cancellation.
