# Can I send unlimited texts?

At first glance, "unlimited texting" sounds like a green light to message as much as you want. And technically, with QuickText, **there’s no built-in limit** — you’re free to send as many messages as you like.

But here’s where things get a bit more nuanced: **your carrier might have something to say about that.**

### 📵 What “Unlimited” Really Means

Most mobile plans throw around the word "unlimited," but there’s usually fine print involved. Carriers often include hidden **Fair Usage Policies**, which are designed to catch behavior that looks automated or excessive — especially when sending to lots of new contacts.

In practice, "unlimited" tends to mean a few hundred messages per day to known contacts. Once you start texting strangers or large volumes, your messages may get throttled, blocked, or your SIM card might even get flagged.

### 🧠 Sending Smart, Not Just Sending More

QuickText doesn’t impose sending caps, but to stay in good standing with your carrier, you’ll want to follow some smart practices:

* ✅ [**SMS Best Practices**](../sms-best-practices-for-deliverability.md) – Keep your messages human and engaging to avoid being flagged.📲

### 💡 Final Thought

Think of QuickText as the engine — your carrier sets the speed limit.

Stick to realistic daily volumes, message like a human, and scale up smartly. That way, you’ll stay under the radar and keep the messages flowing.
