# Does QuickText support RCS chat?

**Yes — RCS is supported**, and you don’t need to do anything special to enable it.

If your contact also has RCS chat enabled and both devices support it, your phone will automatically use RCS instead of SMS for that conversation.

QuickText doesn’t control or force this — it simply works with whatever your phone defaults to. That means RCS will kick in automatically when available.

So if you’re seeing blue bubbles or read receipts, that’s just your phone using RCS in the background.
