# Can I use a VoIP number like Google Voice or Grasshopper?

**No — QuickText does not support VoIP numbers** like Google Voice, Grasshopper, or other internet-based phone services.

### Why Not?

VoIP numbers might look like regular phone numbers, but they behave very differently:

* They rely on internet infrastructure instead of a mobile carrier
* They’re not designed for high-volume texting
* They often have strict spam filters and low message thresholds

### What to Use Instead

For best results, use a **physical SIM or eSIM** from a standard mobile carrier. These offer better reliability, higher daily limits, and fewer restrictions when it comes to sending messages
