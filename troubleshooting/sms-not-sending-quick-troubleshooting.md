# SMS Not Sending: Quick Troubleshooting

If your SMS messages are not being sent, follow these steps:

#### 1. Do you see an error in the status column?

* If **yes**, what does the error say?
  * If it says **"Access denied"**: Your firewall or antivirus is blocking QuickText. Please turn off your antivirus/firewall or add an exception for QuickText, then try again.
  * If it’s a different error: Copy the error and email it to me at sven@pythonandvba.com.

***

#### 2. Are the messages marked as transmitted, but not visible in your SMS app?

* This usually means the connection to your phone was lost.
* Make sure the KDE Connect app stays open on your phone while you send messages. Don’t close or swipe away the app during sending.

***

#### 3. Do you see the messages in your SMS app, but the recipient doesn’t get them?

* Your phone provider may have blocked your number for bulk sending.
* More info and what you can do:\

#### 4. Do you see a warning on your Android phone about sending lots of SMS?

* Tap **Allow** when you see the popup.
