# KDE Connect window stuck on plugin settings

**Problem:**\
After pairing your phone and computer, the KDE Connect window gets stuck on the plugin settings page. The menu button is missing, and you can’t access the main QuickText features.

**Why this happens:**\
This is a small UI glitch in KDE Connect. Sometimes, the menu button goes missing if the window is too wide.

**How to fix it:**

1. Resize the KDE Connect window—make it a bit smaller in width.
2. The menu button should appear again, letting you leave the plugin settings screen.
3. Now you can access the main features as usual.
