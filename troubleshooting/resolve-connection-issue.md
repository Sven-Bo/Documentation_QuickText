# Resolve Connection Issue

<details>

<summary><strong>No device found. Please check KDE Connect on your phone.</strong></summary>

This means your phone is not detected at all. Most of the time, KDE Connect isn’t running on the phone, or the phone is on a different network.

**✅ Steps to fix:**

1. **Make sure KDE Connect is installed on your phone**\
   If it’s not installed, download it from the Play Store and open the app.
2. **Connect both devices to the same Wi-Fi**\
   Mobile data won't work. Your phone and computer must be on the same Wi-Fi network.
3. **Open KDE Connect on your phone**\
   Once open, it should start scanning for nearby devices.
4.  **Click "Refresh Devices" in KDE Connect Desktop**\
    Your phone should now appear in the list.\

<summary><strong>Device is paired but not reachable.</strong></summary>

This usually means the KDE Connect app on your phone has stopped running or cannot be reached.

**✅ Steps to fix:**

1. **Check if KDE Connect is running**\
   Open the KDE Connect app on your phone. If it’s not running, start it manually.
2. **Disable battery-saving mode**\
   Battery optimization can stop background apps like KDE Connect. In your phone settings, exclude KDE Connect from battery-saving features.
3. **Make sure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi**\
   Your phone and your computer must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Mobile data won’t work.

After doing the steps above, click the **Test Connection** button to check if your phone is now reachable.

<summary><strong>Device is reachable but not paired.</strong></summary>

KDE Connect sees your device, so both the phone and computer are on the same Wi-Fi and have KDE Connect installed. The only thing missing is permission to let them talk to each other — pairing.

**✅ Steps to fix:**

1.  **Open KDE Connect on your computer**\
    Your phone should show up as available. Select it and click the **Pair** button.\
