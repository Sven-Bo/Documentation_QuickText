# How does QuickText send SMS from my phone, what's the cost?

QuickText uses [KDE Connect](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/) under the hood. It's a free, open-source tool that connects your phone and computer over Wi-Fi.

**How it works:**

1. Install KDE Connect on your **Windows computer** (from the Microsoft Store) and your **Android phone** (from the Play Store).
2. Once connected, QuickText uses this connection to send your message from Excel to your phone.
3. Your phone then sends the SMS, just like you typed it yourself.

Everything stays local. No messages or data leave your computer. The SMS is sent from your own number, and replies go directly to your phone.

**Cost:**

You only pay for the SMS based on your **mobile plan**.\
Many plans include unlimited texting, so in most cases there is no extra cost.

It also works with **RCS chat** if your phone supports it.
