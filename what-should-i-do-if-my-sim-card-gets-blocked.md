# What should I do if my SIM card gets blocked?

So your SIM card got blocked — frustrating, but not the end of the world. This can happen if you’ve been sending a high volume of messages or triggered a carrier’s spam filter. Here’s how to get back on track quickly.

### 1. Swap in a New SIM Card

The fastest way to start sending again is to pop in a new SIM card.

### 2. Contact Your Carrier

Many carriers allow at least one reactivation. If you call them, they’ll usually tell you what happened — whether it was sending too many texts too fast, lack of replies, or specific flagged content.

Sometimes they’ll even give you helpful tips on how to avoid getting blocked again (and yes, it’s worth asking).

### Pro Tip

If you’re sending regularly at higher volumes, it’s smart to keep a spare SIM card ready. That way, even if you hit a block, you’re not stuck waiting days to send again.

### Final Thought

Getting blocked is annoying, but it’s recoverable. Stay calm, switch SIMs if needed, and adjust your sending habits to avoid future flags. Think of it like getting a speeding ticket — inconvenient, but a good reminder to ease off the gas next time.
