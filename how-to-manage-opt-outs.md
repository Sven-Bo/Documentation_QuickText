# How to manage opt-outs?

QuickText doesn’t force you to include opt-out language in every message — but when someone asks to stop hearing from you, you need to respect it.

Even if you’re not running full-scale SMS campaigns, texting at volume means playing by the same rules as the big platforms. And that includes honoring opt-outs.

### 📬 What Counts as an Opt-Out?

It’s not just when someone says “STOP.” Here are a few examples that clearly signal they don’t want to be contacted:

* “Unsubscribe”
* “Remove me”
* “No thanks”
* “Not interested”

Basically, if the message implies they want out — treat it as an opt-out.

### ✅ What to Do If Someone Opts Out

Since QuickText doesn’t manage unsubscribes for you, you’ll need to handle this manually. Here’s a simple process:

1. Mark the contact as opted out in your CRM, spreadsheet, or contact list
2. Stop all future SMS communication with that number
3. If the contact is still relevant, you can follow up through other channels like email

### Final Thought

Opt-outs are more than just compliance — they’re a way to build trust and protect your number. If you handle them properly, you’re more likely to stay in good standing with both your contacts and your carrier.
