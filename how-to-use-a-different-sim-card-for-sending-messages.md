# How to use a different SIM card for sending messages

If your phone has more than one SIM card or eSIM, and you want to send messages from a different number, you don’t need to change anything in QuickText or KDE Connect. The only thing that matters is which SIM your phone uses by default for SMS.

#### Set the default SIM for SMS on your Android phone

The exact steps vary depending on your phone model and Android version, but it usually looks like this:

1. Open your phone’s **Settings**
2. Go to **Network & Internet**, **Mobile network**, or **Connections**
3. Look for **SIM cards**, **SIM manager**, or **SIM settings**
4. Find the option to set the **default SIM for SMS messages**
5. Choose the SIM or eSIM you want to use for sending

Once this is set, all SMS messages sent through QuickText will go through that number.

#### No setup needed in QuickText

QuickText just follows the system default. You don’t need to change anything inside the Excel file or in KDE Connect.
