# How many SMS messages can I send? Is there a limit?

You can send an unlimited number of SMS messages using QuickText. However, in some cases, your phone provider may impose restrictions, especially if you've never sent bulk messages before or if you're on a prepaid plan. If your messages are blocked or limited, it's often due to your carrier's policies. In such instances, a quick call to your provider explaining that you intend to send a higher volume of messages can usually resolve the issue.
